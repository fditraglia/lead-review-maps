# Approximate $ / IQ point in terms of foregone earnings.
#
# In our IL paper we monetized the loss of one IQ point for a 3-year old as 
# as 20,568 in 2019 dollars, following Klemick, Mason, and Sullivan (2020). This
# is meant to represent the lifetime present value of earnings losses from lower
# cognitive skills. 
# 
# The Klemick et al (2020) figure derives from a 2019 EPA document:
#
#   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2019. 
#   Economic analysis of the final rule to revise the TSCA 
#   dust-lead hazard standards
#
# This document calculates 1.871% lower lifetime earnings for males and 3.409% 
# for females. The average figure is 2.6%. (See Table C-2.) 
#
# We use the 2.6% figure below. But it is estimated from US data, so shouldn't
# be applied directly to countries with different returns to cognitive skills. 
# A back-of-the-envelope approach to generating comparable figures for other 
# countries is as follows:
#
#   2.6% * [returns(X) / returns(US)]
#
# where returns(X) is the returns to schooling in country X and returns(US) is
# the returns to schooling in the US, calculated from Mincer regressions.
