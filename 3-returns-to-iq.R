# There's a small issue we need to think about when comparing results across
# fixed and variable IQ costs: we have fewer countries for the latter exercise,
# so the figures will necessarily be smaller. Not sure of the best way to handle
# this. Maybe fraction of total world GDP? 

# Also need to make sure we're clear on the units here. It's per year but for
# the entire cohort of 0-19 year olds. This is a little bit tricky to think 
# about. Maybe it's clearer to express this per person?

# Yes: per person resolves both issues at once since we normalize by total popn
# among the group of countries for which we are able to make a comparison.

# Estimate the $ benefit from eliminating lead: Version 1
# 
# In our IL paper we monetized the loss of one IQ point for a 3-year old as 
# as 20,568 in 2019 dollars, following Klemick, Mason, and Sullivan (2020). 
# Their calculation was the present value of total lifetime earnings loss in 
# the US. This value may not apply outside the US, but could serve as a simple
# benchmark. 
# 
# If we assume a discount rate between 3 and 4% per year, along with a working
# lifetime between 40 and 45 years, we need to deflate the total figure by a 
# factor of between 20 and 25. This comes to roughly $1000 per year. We want
# a flow so that the figure is comparable to the one we compute below.
