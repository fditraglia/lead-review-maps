# Approximate $ / IQ point in terms of foregone earnings.
#
# In our IL paper we monetized the loss of one IQ point for a 3-year old as 
# as 20,568 in 2019 dollars, following Klemick, Mason, and Sullivan (2020). This
# is meant to represent the lifetime present value of earnings losses from lower
# cognitive skills. 
# 
# This figure shouldn't be applied to countries with different returns to
# cognitive skills. A back-of-the-envelope approach to generating comparable
# figures for other countries is as follows. 
#
# Treat the returns to one additional year of education as the returns to
# cognitive skills. (Note that "ability bias" actually helps us here since we
# are interested in the returns to ability.) Returns to education are expressed
# as a percentage increase in wage per additional year of education. But wages
# also vary across countries. As a rough approximation, use relative GDP per 
# capita to correct for this.
#
# To convert the $20,568 figure for use in country X, calculate as follows:
#
# ($ per IQ point) = 20568 * (returns(X) / returns(US)) * (GDPc(X) / GDPc(US))
# 
# For some countries this will produce a missing value because we don't have 
# returns to education for all the countries for which we have GBD lead data.
