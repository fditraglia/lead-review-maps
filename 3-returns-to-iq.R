# Estimate the $ benefit from eliminating lead: Version 1
# 
# In our IL paper we monetized the loss of one IQ point for a 3-year old as 
# as 20,568 in 2019 dollars, following Klemick, Mason, and Sullivan (2020). 
# Their calculation was the present value of total lifetime earnings loss in 
# the US. This value may not apply outside the US, but could serve as a simple
# benchmark. 
# 
# If we assume a discount rate between 3 and 4% per year, along with a working
# lifetime between 40 and 45 years, we need to deflate the total figure by a 
# factor of between 20 and 25. This comes to roughly $1000 per year. We want
# a flow so that the figure is comparable to the one we compute below.

# The beta and lognormal both give a figure of around 5-6 trillion.
