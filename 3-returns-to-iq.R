# Approximate $ / IQ point in terms of foregone earnings.
#
# In our IL paper we monetized the loss of one IQ point for a 3-year old as 
# as 20,568 in 2019 dollars, following Klemick, Mason, and Sullivan (2020). This
# is meant to represent the lifetime present value of earnings losses from lower
# cognitive skills. 
# 
# This figure shouldn't be applied to countries with different returns to
# cognitive skills. A back-of-the-envelope approach to generating comparable
# figures for other countries is as follows. 
#
# Treat the returns to one additional year of education as the returns to
# cognitive skills. (Note that "ability bias" actually helps us here since we
# are interested in the returns to ability.) Returns to education are expressed
# as a percentage increase in wage per additional year of education. But wages
# also vary across countries. As a rough approximation, use relative GDP per 
# capita to correct for this.
#
# To convert the $20,568 figure for use in country X, calculate as follows:
#
# ($ per IQ point) = 20568 * (returns(X) / returns(US)) * (GDPc(X) / GDPc(US))
# 
# For some countries this will produce a missing value because we don't have 
# returns to education for all the countries for which we have GBD lead data.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An alternative version of this calculation is as follows. Assume a 40 year
# working lifetime and a 3-4%/year discount rate. Under these assumptions the
# $20,568 lifetime discounted figure becomes $864/year. In particular:
#
# T = working lifetime (years)
# r = discount rate (decimal)
# f = discount factor = 1 / (1 + r)
# (Present value of lifetime earnings) = (Annual flow) * (1 - f^T) / (1 - f)
# 
# Rearranging: (Annual flow) = (PV of lifetime earnings) * (1 - f) / (1 - f^T)
#
# The $864/year figure is computed in 2019 US dollars, *not* at purchasing power
# parity and *not* international dollars. So we need to pull 2019 US GDPc in 
# *current* US dollars for this computation. We pull this from the World Bank
# below.
# 
# Now, we can divide the $864/year figure by US GDPc in 2019 to give a pure 
# number (unitless). (Stocks versus flows!) This ratio is roughly the economic 
# cost of one less IQ point per child *relative* to US earnings.
#
# This ratio may not apply to other countries. We adjust it for comparability
# using relative returns to education in country X relative to the US. Our 
# reasoning is that the original $20,568 figure was computed from a Mincer 
# regression that associates IQ to schooling and schooling to earnings so it
# makes sense to adjust for differences in returns to schooling.
#
# [(Annual Flow in $/year) / (US GDPc in $/year)] * [returns(X) / returns(US)]
#
